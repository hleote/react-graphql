# Full stack web app

- React client - (Create React App)
- Apollo client
- GraphQL/Apollo server
- REST API mocked server

# How does it work?

- Git clone
- `npm i` or `yarn` (you should be able to use Yarn if you prefer, should run on Node ver. 14.15.4 also works on Node 12.16.2 and other LTS versions)
- Run REST API server - `npm run start-rest`
- Run the GraphQL server simultaneously in another window using, `npm run start-apollo`
- Start the Create React App using, `npm run start`

# What does it do?

- Renders some elements in the DOM, the main elements that allow user interaction are an Input and a Button components
- Waits for the user to introduce a whole number in the Input field
- Validates the users' input
- Makes a POST/Mutation request through the GraphQL server & the REST API, returns the data to the Apollo client using the `@apollo/client` `useMutation` hook.
- Calculates the value of the fields `val3` & `val5`, which contain the same number, so it multiplies the numbers
- Returns and result

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
